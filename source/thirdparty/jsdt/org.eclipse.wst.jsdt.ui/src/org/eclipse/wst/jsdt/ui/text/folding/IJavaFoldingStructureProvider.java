/**
 * Contributors to the
 * <code>org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.ui.foldingStructureProvider</code> extension
 * point must specify an implementation of this interface which will create and

 * that define folded regions in the {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.source.projection.ProjectionViewer}.
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to provide backward compatibility for clients of <code>IJavaFoldingStructureProvider</code>, extension
 * interfaces are used to provide a means of evolution. The following extension interfaces exist:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.ui.text.folding.IJavaFoldingStructureProviderExtension} since version 3.2 introducing
 *		the following functions:
 *			<ul>
 *            <li>collapsing of comments and members</li>
 *            <li>expanding and collapsing of certain JavaScript elements</li>
 *			</ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>

 * Provisional API: This class/interface is part of an interim API that is still under development and expected to
 * change significantly before reaching stability. It is being made available at this early stage to solicit feedback
 * from pioneering adopters on the understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
 * (repeatedly) as the API evolves. */
